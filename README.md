## Disclaimer

- Zenbot is NOT a sure-fire profit machine. Use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- Crypto-currency is still an experiment, and therefore so is Zenbot. Meaning, both may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general requires careful study of the risks and parameters involved. A wrong setting can cause you a major loss.
- Never leave the bot un-monitored for long periods of time. Zenbot doesn't know when to stop, so be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.
- Often times the default trade parameters will underperform vs. a buy-hold strategy, so run some simulations and find the optimal parameters for your chosen exchange/pair before going "all-in".

## Quick-start

### 1. Requirements: Preferred running in screen on google cloud compute UBUNTU XENIAL instance, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and Python3.

### 2. Install zenbot 4:

Run in your console,

```
git clone https://github.com/TheRoboKitten/zenaii.git /zenaii
```

Then run:
```
sudo sh setup.sh
```

Obtaining your Telegram ``API ID`` and ``Hash``
===============================================
In order to use Telethon, you first need to obtain your very own API ID and Hash:

1. Follow `this link <https://my.telegram.org>`_ and login with your phone number.
2. Click under *API Development tools*.
3. A *Create new application* window will appear. Fill in your application details.
   There is no need to enter any *URL*, and only the first two fields (*App title* and *Short name*)
   can be changed later as long as I'm aware.
4. Click on *Create application* at the end.

Now that you know your ``API ID`` and ``Hash``, you can continue installing Telethon.

Installing Telethon
===================


Installing Telethon manually
----------------------------

1. Install the required ``pyaes`` module: ``sudo -H pip install pyaes`` and ``sudo apt install python3 python3-pip``
2. Run the code generator: ``python3 setup.py gen_tl``
3. Run the code install: ``python3 setup.py install``
